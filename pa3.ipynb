In this assignment, you will write code to analyze the trajectory of ballistic or projectile motion in a video to determine if it is real or not. Ballistic motion occurs when the only significant force on an object is gravity (e.g., a basketball free-throw). We will analyze videos in which this type of motion is imaged such that the camera is perfectly perpendicular to the object’s path of motion.\n",

One way we can simplify this process is by building a composite image that shows the ball's movement across the frames all in one picture. You can then select points from this one image and store those coordinates for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is initialization. There are 100 video frames in the zip file. Some of the videos that we will have you analyze have a large number of video frames, so to simplify things we will only analyze every fourth frame. Set up a constant `STEP` that controls how many frames to use and how many to pass over. If, for example `STEP = 1`, then every frame of the video will be stored; if `STEP = 4`, then only every fourth frame will be stored. You should also set up a constant `TFRAMES` dictating the number of frames to loop through. Lastly, you should set up a `coords` array to store the coordinates. `coords` should be an $n \\times 2$ matrix, where $n$ is the number of coordinates you select from the image of ballistic motion. You can set up a NumPy array of zeros using `np.zeros()`, and designate the shape by passing in a tuple `(# of rows, # of cols)` as a parameter. Start off with zero rows and 2 columns."

The height and width of an image can be accessed by calling `.shape[0]` and `.shape[1]` on an individual frame. We are using color videos, so the number of channels (red, green, blue) is 3. Num frames is again the desired number of frames to store. You will need to pass in `dtype = np.uint8` after the shape parameter in the empty matrix to specify the matrix objects as pixel values. You can load one frame by calling `plt.imread('framefilename')`, or load multiple frames using `plt.imread('frame%d.jpg' % c)` where c is the frame number."
